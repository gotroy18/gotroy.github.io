    <center><p><br>Good day, my name is Troy Go, and I'm 20 years old. I was born and raised in Las Pinas City and I am 
currently a 2nd-year college student studying in Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa and taking up a 
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I’m going to tell you more about myself and my life. We are 
five in the family my Mom and Dad and my two siblings, my oldest brother is 23 years old, and my 
youngest sister is 15 years old.</p></center></br>

<center><p><br>I grew up with a lot of memories to remember from my childhood experiences with my friends and 
family. Every afternoon after I woke up from my afternoon nap I go outside and play games such as 
basketball and mobile games, and until now I like to play games but as soon as I get older I have to lessen 
such activities to focus on my responsibilities and priorities as a student but I'm still doing some exercises 
to maintain my good health, and to maintain my good health I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and I also 
do regular cycling which increased cardiovascular fitness, increased muscle strength and flexibility, 
improved joint mobility, and decreased stress. And if I have free time I watch movies while watching I eat 
some snacks to enjoy watching and I also go out with my friends to have some fun from time to time. 
And if it's already time to go back to school I wake up early in the morning because I have to travel for 
almost one hour and after my class, I went to Alabang with my friends to eat some street foods like 
kwek-kwek, fish ball, squid balls, and balut, balut is my favorite among them because it's so delicious 
while it's still hot and with lots of spicy sauce. But some of my friends don't like balut and I don't know 
why.</p></center></br>

<center><p><br>And during every summer my family is planning some outings or swimming with some of our friends 
and relatives and summer is my favorite time of the year because I have so much time to enjoy my 
vacation away from school works.</p></center></br>

<center><p><br>When I was young, I dreamed of becoming a famous player in the field of online gaming, until now I 
still hoping of becoming one. But since I’m still studying I chose to focus on my studies to avoid 
distraction, I still play online game like mobile legends from time to time with my friends when I’m not 
doing anything or after I finished all my school works, and aside from online games I also love biking
around our place to exercise.</p></center></br>

<center><p><br>Someday, I want to be a good programmer, this is my second choice since I decided not to shift course 
to criminology since my first choice was to become a policeman but due to some circumstances I was 
not able to shift. Since some of my friends are telling me that I can still be a policeman in different fields 
like police technology so I decided to continue and decided not to shift course since I can still apply my 
knowledge and skills in computer science in this kind of job in the future</p></center></br>
